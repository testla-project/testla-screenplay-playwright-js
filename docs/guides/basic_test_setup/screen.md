# Screen

The `screen` represents elements/static properties that can be used to identify and interact with on a screen.
It is designed to make the automation of actions more convenient.

```typescript
export class LoginScreen {
    static EMAIL_INPUT = 'email-input locator';

    static PASSWORD_FIELD = 'password-field locator';

    static LOGIN_BUTTON = 'Log in button locator';
}
```
