# Logging

> This feature is currently in experimental stage and might see bigger changes.

Testla comes with logging which helps you to debug your test code. When logging is enabled all activities an actor triggers are logged in a comprehensive way to stdout. To enable logging set the DEBUG environment variable as follows:

```typescript
DEBUG=testla:sp
```

To understand how to enable logging in custom Actions and Questions please refer to the [logging guide](https://github.com/testla-project/testla-screenplay-core-js/blob/main/doc/logging.md) of Testla Screenplay Core.
